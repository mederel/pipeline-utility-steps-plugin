<p>
    Reads a file in the current working directory or a String as a plain text
    <a href="http://www.json.org/json-it.html" target="_blank">JSON</a> file.
    The returned object is a normal Map with String keys or a List of primitives or Map.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Example:</strong><br/>
    <code><pre>
def props = readJSON file: 'dir/input.json'
assert props['attr1'] == 'One'
assert props.attr1 == 'One'

def props = readJSON text: '{ "key": "value" }'
assert props['key'] == 'value'
assert props.key == 'value'

def props = readJSON text: '[ "a", "b"]'
assert props[0] == 'a'
assert props[1] == 'b'

def props = readJSON text: '{ "key": null, "a": "b" }', returnPojo: true
assert props['key'] == null
props.each { key, value ->
    echo "Walked through key $key and value $value"
}
	</pre></code>
</p>
<p>
    If you want that readJSON to always behave as if returnPojo were true, i.e. that readJSON always returns
    LinkedHashMap or ArrayList instead of JSONObject and JSONArray, you can either:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        set the following system property in your java start command:<br/>
        <code><pre>
-Dorg.jenkinsci.plugins.pipeline.utility.steps.json.ReadJSONStep.returnPojo=true
        </pre></code>
    </li>
    <li>
        or define the environment variable <code>PIPELINE_UTILITY_JSON_RETURN_POJOS</code> with value <code>true</code>
    </li>
</ul>
